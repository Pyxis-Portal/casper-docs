# Read-Only Casper Nodes in AWS

The procedure to instantiate Casper nodes in AWS builds on the methodologies detailed in [Installing a Node](../setup/install-node.md), excluding the steps for network bonding and acquiring validator status. Bonding converts a node into a validator node, a concept outside the scope of the IaC infrastructure. Thus, Casper nodes configured with this approach operate as read-only nodes.

## Advantages of using IaC in AWS

Running a Casper node using IaC in AWS has the following advantages:

* An operator can create a node with a single command, which manages the creation of the entire infrastructure.
* Operators can add a security layer, including a VPN server, for secure access to the node.
* This architecture includes an auto-scaling mechanism, which takes care of the node lifecycle, allowing automatic recovery if the node is unresponsive, creating a new node, and replacing the unresponsive one.
* The node maintains the same public IP.
* A secure service can manage credentials.
* This infrastructure performs backups of the nodeâ€™s data once the node achieves synchronization. The default schedule runs every Friday at 00:00:00.

## Architecture

This architecture aims to uphold the integrity and security of the Casper node. Should an unexpected shutdown occur, the autoscaling group will generate a new node with the identical keys and data.
